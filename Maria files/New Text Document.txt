Because of this the EMG in voltage from one subject cannot be compared to another's. Since the skin thickness and other anatomical differences can cause value discrepancies.
Therefore a normalization was established by dividing the values in Volts by the mean of all the values and multiplying by 100. So that inter-subject data can be compared with validity.













In our design of our musculoskeletal system we used the mechanical aproximation designed by Hill. et all.

This mechanical system hopes to reproduce the four properties that are seen in the muscle tissue:


1-Extensibility - The tissue can increase length
Elasticity - 
Irritability
Contractility
